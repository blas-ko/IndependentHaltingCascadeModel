## Overview

This repository provides the code for simulating the Independent Halting Cascade (IHC) model as well as Jupyter notebooks for performing the experiments and figures of our paper [Incentivized Network Dynamics in Digital Job Recruitment](https://doi.org/10.1093/comnet/cnaf047) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09698)), published on the *Journal of Complex Networks (2025)*.

## Features

- Simulates the IHC model on networks
- Models halting behavior based on incentives
- Customizable network structures and parameters
- Notebooks for running experiments and producing publication-quality figures

## Usage

- Experiments performed in the paper are provided in Jupyter notebooks [experiments_heterogeneous.ipynb](https://github.com/blas-ko/IndependentHaltingCascadeModel/blob/main/notebooks/experiments_heterogeneous.ipynb) and [experiments_homogeneous.ipynb](https://github.com/blas-ko/IndependentHaltingCascadeModel/blob/main/notebooks/experiments_homogeneous.ipynb)
- Figures for the paper are created in [Plots.ipynb](https://github.com/blas-ko/IndependentHaltingCascadeModel/blob/main/notebooks/Plots.ipynb)
- Basic usage of the model is provided in [basic_usage.ipynb](https://github.com/blas-ko/IndependentHaltingCascadeModel/blob/main/notebooks/basic_usage.ipynb), where you can play around with your own parameters and networks.
